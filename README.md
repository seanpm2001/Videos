## Videos in Markdown

I have not yet mastered the art of embedding videos in Markdown, and I don't plan to include very many videos per Markdown file.

## Repositories

- [:octocat: `SVG Video`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/SVG_Video/)

> SVG Video is a video format that utilizes SVG to make high quality, expandable (360p can easily be upscaled to 4320p with no quality drop) open, and less dense (smaller file size) videos. Due to its complexity, the drawbacks are that it is harder to program, and requires higher CPU usage

- [:octocat: `CamCam++`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/CamCamPlus/)

> CamCamPlus (stylized as CamCam+ or CamCam++) is an advanced camera application written in C++
